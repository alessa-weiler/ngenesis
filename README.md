I have made myself a project: to build a minimalist website. On this website, clinicians must first log in with their credentials. after logging in, they can create a new client card, and view their existing client cards if there are any. To create a new client card, they must input, in a text box, all their notes on the patient. They have the option to attach images of documents as well. The next section of the client card is blood tests, hormone tests and gene tests, which are all optional inputs. Using a chatgpt api, all of this information will be analysed to produce a detailed report of the patient, including the patients' symptoms on a scale of 1 to 10 in a spider diagram based on chatgpt's analysis of the patient notes, as well as suggested lifestyle modifications to improve the patients' outcomes and symptoms. All of this information can be accessed on the client card when it is clicked. The clinician can log out at any time, which goes back to the main login page.

A second part of the project is to develop an app for people to log their symptoms, where they feel their emotions in their body, and the option to do CBT 'workouts' on the app - like a workout app for the brain. this information can then be sent to the healthcare provider,
